Rhino species populations are at a critical level due to the demand of rhino horn
and the subsequent poaching. Wild life managers, who are in charge of the
protected areas, attempt to secure the life of the animal using several devaluing
approaches. The most common approach is dehorning. Nonetheless, dehorning does
not always repel the poachers. In order for dehorning to be successful a poacher
must choose to only kill rhinos with full horns, thus be a â€˜selective poacher'.
Indiscriminate poachers also exist, which are poachers who choose to
kill all rhinos they encounter.

In 2016, the interaction between a rhino manager and poachers was investigated
for the first time using a game theoretic model. The interaction was
formulated as a two players normal form game where each player had a set of two
actions. A manager could choose between dehorning or not, and a poacher could choose
to behave selectively or indiscriminately. The paper discussed two of the nash
equilibriam of the game and concluded that poachers will always choose to behave
indiscriminately.

In this manuscript, we explore the population dynamic effects associated to these interactions.
More specifically, the interaction between poachers is investigated using
evolutionary game theory. The game considered is not of a two player game anymore
(manager and poacher) but now an infinite population of poachers is considered.
The purpose of the work is to determine which strategy is preferred by a poacher
in various different populations of poachers and whether conditions which encourage
poachers to behave selectively exist. This is explored using both analytical and
numerical methods. Analytical methods include investigating the underlying
differential equations of the population.

The findings confirm that behaving selectively will not persist, not even
in a mixed population using the fact that the only evolutionary stable strategy
is the indiscriminate one. Meaning, that for any
given starting population, the poachers would evolve to adopt an indiscriminate
behaviour. However, our results reveal that it is possible for a population of
selective poachers to exist, but for this to occur a disincentive must be applied
to the utility of indiscriminate poachers. The disincentive factor can have
several interpretations; such as engaging the rural communities that live with
wildlife.
