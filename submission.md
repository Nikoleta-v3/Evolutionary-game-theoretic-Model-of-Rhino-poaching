Rhino species populations are at a critical level due the demand of rhino horn
and the subsequent poaching. Wild life managers, who are in charge of the
protected areas, attempt to secure the life of the animal using several devaluing
approaches. The most common approach is dehorning. Nonetheless, dehorning does
not always repel the poachers. In order for dehorning to be successful a poacher
must choose to only kill rhinos with full horns, thus be a ‘selective poacher'.
Any how, ‘indiscriminate poachers’ also exist, which are poachers can choose to
kill all rhinos they encounter.

In 2016, the interaction between a rhino manager and poachers was investigated
for the first time using a game theoretical modelling. The interaction was
formulated as a two players normal form game where each player had a set of two
actions. A manager can choose between dehorning or not, and a poacher can choose
to behave selectively or indiscriminately. The paper discusses two of the nash
equilibriam of the game and concludes that poachers will always choose to behave
indiscriminately. Thus the most common equilibrium is that where a poacher is
indiscriminate and a manager does not dehorn.

In this manuscript, we explore the population dynamic effect of these strategies.
More specifically, the interaction between poachers is investigated using
evolutionary game theory. The game considered is not of a two players anymore
(manager and poacher) but now the players are an infinite population of poachers.
The purpose of the work is to determine which strategy is preferred by a poacher
in various different populations of poachers and whether conditions which encourage
poachers to behave selectively exist. This is explored by both analytical an
numerical methods. Analytical methods include investigating the underlying
differential equations of the population.

Our findings confirm that behaving selectively will not persist, not even
in a mixed population. Moreover, it was proven that the only evolutionary
stable strategy is the indiscriminate one. Meaning, that for any
given starting population, the poachers would evolve to adopt an indiscriminate
behaviour. However, our result reveal that it is possible for a population of
selective poachers to exist, but for this to occur a disincentive must be applied
to the utility of indiscriminate poachers. The disincentive factor can have
several interpretations; such as engaging the rural communities that live with
wildlife.

The insights gained from this manuscript, notably that a population of selective
poachers is sustainable only if a large disincentive is in place (even if all
rhinos have been dehorned) have implication at the long term national policy
level. Furthermore, dehorning is empirically thought to be one of the best
responses to poaching. This indicates that whilst of theoretic and macroeconomic
interest the modelling approach investigated in this work has potential for further
work.
