In recent years the rhino species are close to extinction. This is due
a large demand of rhino horn in the black/illegal market. Though wild rhino
camp managers are trying several new methods to secure the life of the animal
it has not proven to have significant effect.

Devaluation of the rhino horn is a common mean of securing the life of the animal.
The most common ones being either having security on the ground or removing the
horn of the animal.

Sciences always find new ways to intersect several fields. In 2016 the first paper
that approached the devaluation of rhino horn using game theory was published.

Our work build on it using evolutionary game theory to actually study the
interaction of poachers and managers using population dynamics. This is
achievable through a straight forward theoretical mathematical framework of the
poaching world.

Our work gives new insights to the decisions of the managers but furthermore
builds a new road of studying the topic. Thus apart from new interesting results
we allows for further work. Such as, the interactions of neighbour camps or 
even build more on our model, to make more sophisticated and include other possible 
actions for the poachers.
