\begin{abstract}

Rhino populations are at a critical level due to the demand for rhino horn and
the subsequent poaching. Wildlife managers attempt to secure rhinos with
approaches to devalue the horn, the most common of which is dehorning. Game theory
has been used to examine the interaction of poachers and wildlife managers where
a manager can either `dehorn' their rhinos or leave the horn attached and poachers
may behave `selectively' or `indiscriminately'. The approach described in this paper
builds on this previous
work and investigates the interactions between the poachers. We build an evolutionary
game theoretic model and determine which strategy is preferred by a poacher in various
different populations of poachers. The purpose of this work is to discover whether
conditions which encourage the poachers to behave selectively exist, that is,
they only kill those rhinos with full horns.

The analytical
results show that full devaluation of all Rhinos will likely lead to
indiscriminate poaching. In turn it shows the devaluing of Rhinos can only be
effective when implemented along with a strong incentive framework.
This paper aims to
contribute to the necessary research required for informed discussion about the
lively debate on legalising rhino horn trade.

%=============================================
\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}

Rhino populations now persist largely in protected areas or on private land, and
require intensive protection~\cite{Ferreira2014} because the demand for rhino
horn continues to pose a serious threat~\cite{Amin2006}. The illegal trade in rhino
horn supports aggressive poaching syndicates and a black market~\cite{Nowell1992, Warchol2003}.
This lucrative market entices people to invest their time and energy to gain a
`windfall' in the form of a rhino horn, through the poaching of rhinos. In recent
years poaching has escalated to an unprecedented level resulting in concerns over
their future existence~\cite{Duan2013,Smith1993}. Several methods
include addressing the problem by reducing the demand in the market. In~\cite{Duan2013}
the authors suggest meeting the demand for rhino horn through a legal market by
farming the rhino horn from live rhinos. This controversial proposal is an active
conversation, with the actual quantity of horn that could be farmed being estimated
recently by \cite{Taylor2017}. Moreover, the debate is not limited to rhinos -
\cite{Harvey2017} considered ivory and stated that by enforcing a domestic ivory
trade ban we can reduce the market's demand.

Nonetheless, for wildlife managers law enforcement is often one of the main methods
to deter poachers.
In response, rhino conservation has seen increased  militarisation with `boots on the
ground' and `eyes in the sky'~\cite{duffy_st}. An alternative method is to
devalue the horn itself, one of the main  methods being the removal so that only
a stub is left. The first attempt at large-scale rhino dehorning as an anti-poaching
measure was in Damaraland, Namibia, in 1989~\cite{Milner1992}. Other methods
of devaluing the horn that have been suggested include
the insertion of poisons, dyes or GPS trackers~\cite{Gill2010,Smith1993}. However,
like dehorning, they cannot remove all the potential gain from an intact horn
(poison and dyes fade or GPS trackers can be removed and have been found to affect
only a small proportion of the horn).
In~\cite{Milner1992} they found the
optimum proportion to dehorn using mean horn length as a measure of the
proportion of rhinos dehorned. They showed, with realistic parameter values,
that the optimal strategy is to dehorn as many rhinos as possible.
A manager does not need to choose between law enforcement or devaluing, but
perhaps adopt a combination of the two; especially given that devaluing rhinos
comes at a cost to the manager, and the process comes with a risk to the rhinos.

A recent paper modelled the interaction between a rhino manager and poachers
using game theory~\cite{Lee}. The authors consider a working year of a single
rhino manager. A manager is assumed to have standard yearly resources which
can be allocated on devaluing a proportion of their rhinos or spent on security.
It is assumed that all rhinos initially have intact horns. Poachers may either only
kill rhinos with full horns, `selective poachers', or kill all rhinos they encounter,
`indiscriminate poachers'. This strategy may be preferred to avoid tracking a
devalued rhino again, and/or to gain the value from the partial horn. If all rhinos
are left by the rhino manager with their intact horns, it does not pay poachers to
be selective so they will chose to be indiscriminate since being selective incurs
an additional cost to discern the status of the rhino. Conversely, if all poachers are
selective, it pays rhino managers to invest in devaluing their rhinos.
Assuming poachers and managers will always behave so as to maximise their payoff,
there are two equilibriums: either all rhinos are devalued and all poachers are selective;
or all horns are intact and all poachers are indiscriminate. Essentially, either
the managers win and rhinos survive or the poachers win and rhinos are killed. The
paper~\cite{Lee} concludes that poachers will always choose to behave indiscriminately,
and thus the game settles to the bottom right quadrant, i.e., the poachers win.


In this manuscript, we explore the population dynamic effects associated to
the interactions described by~\cite{Lee}. More specifically, the interaction between
poachers. In a population full of indiscriminate poachers is there
a benefit to a single poacher becoming selective or vice versa? This notion
is explored here using evolutionary game theory~\cite{Smith}. The
game is not that of two players anymore (manager and poacher) but now the players
are an infinite population of poachers. This allows for the interaction between
poachers over multiple plays of the game to be explored with the rhino manager
being the one that creates the conditions of the population.

Note that poachers are, in practice finite, and each has individual factors that will
affect a poacher's behaviour. An infinite population model corresponds to either
an asymptotic generalisation or overall descriptive behaviour.

In evolutionary game theory, we assume infinite populations and in our
model this is represented by \(\chi=(x_1, x_2)\) with \(x_1\) being the proportion
of the population using a strategy of the first type and \(x_2\) of the second. We
assume there are utility functions \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) that map the population
to a fitness for each strategy, given by,

\[ u_1(\chi)  \text{ and } u_2(\chi).\]

In evolutionary game theory these utilities are used to dictate the evolution of
the population over time, according to the following differential equations,

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:u_differential_eq}
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{cl}
    \dfrac{dx_1}{dt}=x_1(u_1(\chi)-\phi),
    \\
    \\
    \dfrac{dx_2}{dt}= x_2(u_2(\chi)-\phi),
    \end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray}

In some settings these utilities are referred to as fitness and/or are mapped to
a further measure of fitness. This is not the case considered here (it is
assumed all evolutionary dynamics are considered by the utility measures).

where \(\phi\) is the average fitness of the whole population. Here, the overall
population is assumed to remain stable thus, \(x_1 + x_2 = 1 \) and

\begin{eqnarray}
    \dfrac{dx_1}{dt}  + \dfrac{dx_2}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow x_1(u_1(\chi) - \phi)
     + x_2(u_2(\chi) - \phi)=0.
\end{eqnarray}

Recalling that \(x_1 + x_2 = 1\) the average fitness can be written as,

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:average_fitness}
    \phi=x_1u_1(\chi) + x_2u_2(\chi).
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent{} By substituting (\ref{eqn:average_fitness}) and \(x_2= 1 - x_1\)
in (\ref{eqn:u_differential_eq}),

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:u_differential_simplified}
    \frac{dx_1}{dt}= x_1(1 - x_1)(u_1(\chi) - u_2(\chi)).
\end{eqnarray}

The equilibria of the differential equation (\ref{eqn:u_differential_simplified})
are given by, \(x_1=0\), \(x_1=1\), and \(0<x_1<1\) for \(u_1(\chi)=u_2(\chi)\).
These equilibria correspond to stability of the population: the differential
equation (\ref{eqn:u_differential_simplified}) no longer changes.

The notion of evolutionary stability can be checked only for these stable strategies.
For a stable strategy to be an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) it must remain
the best response even in a mutated population \(\chi_\epsilon\). A mutated population
is the post entry population
where a small proportion \(\epsilon > 0\) starts deviating and adopts a different strategy.
Fig.~\ref{fig:stable_ess_driagrams} illustrates two potential strategies: without
outside stimulation neither marble would move. In Fig.~\ref{fig:ess_diagram}
however the stability can be described as ``stronger": with a small nudge the marble
would return to its stable position. In Fig.~\ref{fig:stable_diagram} any non-zero
nudge would move the marble out of its equilibria.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

In Section~\ref{section:the_model}, we determine expressions
for \(u_1, u_2\) that correspond to a population of wild rhino poachers and we
explore the stability of the equilibria identified in~\cite{Lee}. The results
contained in this paper are proven analytically, and more specifically it is
shown that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In the presence of sufficient risk: a population of selective poachers
        is stable.
    \item Full devaluation of all rhinos will lead to indiscriminate poachers.
\end{itemize}

This implies that under almost all conditions, no matter what current proportion
of
of poachers are acting selectively, the population will eventually turn into a
population of only indiscriminate poachers.

%============================================================
\section{The Utility Model}\label{section:the_model}

As discussed briefly in Section~\ref{section:introduction}, a rhino poacher
can adopt two strategies, to either behave selectively
or indiscriminately. To calculate the utility for each strategy, the gain and cost
that poachers are exposed to must be taken into account. The poacher incurs a
loss from seeking a rhino, and the risk involved. The gain depends upon the value
of horn, the proportion of horn remaining after the manager has devalued the
rhino horn and the number of rhinos (devalued and not).

Let us first consider the gain to the poacher, where \(\theta\) is the amount of
horn taken. We assume rhino horn value is determined by weight only, a
reasonable assumption as rhino horn is sold in a grounded form~\cite{Saverhino}.
Clearly if the horn is intact, the amount of horn gained is \(\theta=1\) for
both the selective and the indiscriminate poacher.  If the rhino horn has been
devalued, and the poacher is selective, the amount of horn gained is
\(\theta=0\) as the poacher does not kill. However, if the poacher is behaving
indiscriminately, the proportion of value gained from the horn is \(\theta =
\theta_r\) (for some \(0<\theta_r<1\)). Therefore, the amount of horn gained in
the general case is

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:theta}
    \theta(r, x) = x (1 - r) + (1 - x)(1-r+r\theta_r)
\end{eqnarray}
where \(r\) is the proportion of rhinos that have been devalued, and \(x\) is the
proportion of selective poachers and \(1-x\) is the proportion of indiscriminate
poachers. Note that since \(\theta_r, r, x  \in [0, 1]\), then
\(\theta(r, x) > 0\), that is, some horn will be taken. Standard supply and demand
arguments imply that the value
of rhino horn decreases as the quantity of horn available increases~\cite{mankiw2010}.
Thus at any given time the expected gain is

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:individual_gain}
    H \theta(r, x)^{-\alpha},
\end{eqnarray}
where \(H\) is a scaling factor associated with the value of a full horn, and
\(\alpha \geq 0\) is a constant that determines the precise relationship between
the quantity and value of the horn.  Fig.~\ref{fig:GainCurve}, verifies that the
gain curve corresponds to a demand curve.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/gain_curve.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:GainCurve} \(H \theta(r, x) ^{- \alpha}\) for values
\(H = 10, \theta_r = 0.3\) and \(x = 0.2.\)}
\end{figure}

An individual interacts with the population which is uniquely determined by
\(x\), the proportion of selective poachers.
Therefore, the gain for a poacher in the population \(x\) is either
% Beginning of some notation changes
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:gain}
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{cl}
    \theta(r, 1) H \theta(r, x)^{-\alpha} & \mbox{ selective poacher}
    \\
    \theta(r, 0) H \theta(r, x)^{-\alpha} & \mbox{ indiscriminate poacher}
    \end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray}
depending on the chosen strategy of the individual.

Secondly we consider the costs incurred by the poacher.

It is assumed that a given poacher will spend sufficient time in the park to
obtain the equivalent of at least a single Rhinoceros's horn. For selective poachers this
implies searching the park for a fully valued horn and for indiscriminate
poachers this implies either finding a fully valued horn or finding \(N_r\)
total Rhinoceroses where \(N_r = \lceil 1 / \theta_r \rceil\).

Figure~\ref{fig:random_walk} shows a random walk that any given poacher will
follow in the park. Both types of poacher will exit the park as soon as they
encounter a fully valued Rhino, which at every encounter is assumed to happen
with probability \(1 - r\). However, the indiscriminate poachers may also exit
the park if they encounter \(N_r\) devalued Rhinos in a row.  Each step on the
random walk is assumed to last 1 time unit: during which a Rhino is found.  To
capture the fact that indiscriminate poachers will spend a different amount of
time to selective poachers with each Rhino the parameter \(t\) is introduced
which corresponds to the amount of time it takes to find and kill a Rhino (thus
\(t\geq 1\)).

    \end{center}
    \caption{Illustrative random walk showing the points at which an
    indiscriminate or a selective poacher will leave the park}

    \label{fig:random_walk}
\end{figure}

Using this, the expected time spent in the park \(T_1, T_2\) by poachers of both
types can be obtained:

For selective poachers:

\begin{align}
    T_1 &= (1-r)t + r(1-r)(1+t) + r^2(1-r)(2+t) + \dots\\
        &= (1-r)\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}r^i(i+t)\\
        &= (1-r)\left(1/r\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}ir^{(i+1)} + t\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}r^i\right)\\
        &= (1-r)\left(\frac{r}{(1-r)^2} + \frac{t}{1-r}\right) && \text{ using standard
formulae for geometric series}\\
    &= \frac{r+t(1-r)}{1-r}
\end{align}

For indiscriminate poachers:

\begin{align}
    T_2 &= (1-r)t + r(1-r)2t + r^2(1-r)3t + \dots + r^{N_r - 2}(1-r)(N_r - 1)t + r^{N_r - 1}N_rt\\
        &= (1-r)t\sum_{i=1}^{N_r - 1}ir^{i-1} + r^{N_r - 1}N_rt \\
        &= (1-r)t\left(\frac{1}{r \left(r - 1\right)^{2}} \left(N_{r} r
r^{N_{r}} - N_{r} r^{N_{r}} - r r^{N_{r}} + r\right)\right) + r^{N_r - 1}N_rt \\
        &= \frac{t(1 - r^{N_r})}{(1 - r)}
\end{align}

Additionally, the poachers are also exposed to a risk. The risk to the poacher is
directly related to the proportion of rhinos not devalued, \(1 - r\), since
the rhino manager can spend more on security if the cost of devaluing is low.
In real life this is not always the case. The cost of security can be extremely
high thus it cannot be guaranteed that much security will be added from the
saved money. However, our model assumes that there is a proportional and negative
relationship between the measures.

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:risk}
    (1 - r)^{\beta},
\end{eqnarray}

where \(\beta \geq 0\) is a constant that determines the precise relationship
between the proportion of rhinos not devalued and the security on the grounds.
Therefore, at any given time the expected cost for a poacher is,

\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:cost}
        FT_i(1 - r)^{\beta} \text{ for } i \in \{1, 2\}
\end{eqnarray}
where \(F\) is a constants that determines the precise relationship. Fig.
\ref{fig:CostCurves} verifies the decreasing relationship between \(r\) and the
cost.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/betas_curve.pdf}
        \caption{Costs associated to both poachers for varying values of \(r\)
        and \(t\).}\label{fig:CostCurves}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

One final consideration given to the utility model is the incorporation of a
disincentive to indiscriminate poachers. Numerous interpretations can be
incorporated with this:

\begin{itemize}
    \item more severe punishment for indiscriminate killing of rhinos;
    \item educational interventions that highlight the negative aspects of
        indiscriminate killing;
    \item the possibility of a better alternative being offered to selective
        poachers.
\end{itemize}

This will be captured by a constant \(\Gamma\).

\noindent Combining~(\ref{eqn:gain}) and (\ref{eqn:cost}) gives the utility
functions for selective poachers, \(u_1(x)\), and indiscriminate poachers,
\(u_2(x)\),

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:USchi}
u_1(x) &=& \theta(r,1) H \theta(r,x)^{-\alpha}
           - (r+t(1-r))F (1-r)^{\beta - 1} ,
\\
\label{eqn:UnotSchi}
u_2(x) &=& \theta(r,0) H \theta(r,x)^{-\alpha} - t(1 - r^{N_r})F(1-r)^{\beta-1}
- \Gamma
\end{eqnarray}


Given a specific individual, let \(s\) denote the probability of them behaving
selectively.
Thus the general utility function for an individual poacher in the population with
a proportion of \(0 \leq x \leq 1\) selective poachers is

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:utility}
u(s, x) = s u_1(x) +(1 - s) u_2(x).
\end{eqnarray}
Substituting~(\ref{eqn:USchi}) and~(\ref{eqn:UnotSchi}) into~(\ref{eqn:utility})
and using (\ref{eqn:theta}) gives,

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:tutility2}
u(s, x) &=&
           H (\theta_r r(1-s) - r + 1)\theta(r,x)^{-\alpha} -
           F\left(sr+st(1-r)+(1-s)t(1-r^{N_r})\right)(1-r)^{\beta-1}
           -(1-s)\Gamma
\end{eqnarray}

Figure~\ref{fig:evolution_of_system} shows the evolution of the system over time
for a variety of initial populations and parameters.
This is done using numerical integration implemented  in~\cite{scipy}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/evolution_of_system.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:evolution_of_system} The change of the population over

    \alpha=2, \beta=.99, t=1.5, \theta_r=0.01, \Gamma=0\).}
\end{figure}

Two different outcomes seem to be evolutionarily stable, for the higher values
of \(r\) the security is low and the only way to obtain utility from poaching is
to act indiscriminately. When \(r\) is lower, then there is less utility and
sufficient full valued Rhinos to ensure the risk of acting selectively is
sufficiently low.

In Section~\ref{section:evolutionary_stability}, these observations will be
confirmed theoretically.

%=======================================================
\section{Evolutionary Stability}\label{section:evolutionary_stability}

By definition, for a strategy to be an ESS it must first be a best response to an
environment where the entire population is playing the same strategy.
In our model there are three possible stable distributions based on the
equilibria of equation (\ref{eqn:u_differential_simplified}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item all poachers are selective;
    \item all poachers are indiscriminate;
    \item mixed population of selective and indiscriminate poachers.
\end{itemize}

An ESS corresponds to asymptotic behaviour near the equilibria of
(\ref{eqn:u_differential_simplified}), this correspond to the concept of
Lyapunov stability~\cite{lyapunov1992general}.

For simplicity, denote the right hand side of
(\ref{eqn:u_differential_simplified}) as \(f\).
In this setting, when \(x\) is near to some equilibria \(x^*\) (so that
\(f(x^*)=0\) then the evolutionary game can be linearized (using standard Taylor
Series expansion) as:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d(x^* + \epsilon)}{dt} = J(x^*)\epsilon
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
    J(a) = \left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{x=a}
\end{equation}

This gives a standard approach for evaluating equilibria of the underlying game.
For a given equilibria \(x^*\), \(J(x^*)<0\) if and only if \(x^*\) is an ESS\@.

Using equations (\ref{eqn:USchi}) and (\ref{eqn:UnotSchi}):

\begin{equation}
    J(a) = \frac{1}{\left(r - 1\right) \left(- a r \theta_{r} + r \theta_{r} - r
+ 1\right)^{\alpha + 1}} \left(J_1 - J_2 \right) + \Gamma(1 - 2a)\end{equation}

where:

\begin{align}
    J_1 & = F \left(- r + 1\right)^{\beta} \left(- a r \theta_{r} + r \theta_{r}
    - r + 1\right)^{\alpha + 1} \left(2 a r t - 2 a r - 2 a
r^{\lceil{\frac{1}{\theta_{r}}}\rceil} t - r t + r +
r^{\lceil{\frac{1}{\theta_{r}}}\rceil} t\right)\\
    J_2 & = H a \alpha r^{2} \theta_{r}^{2} \left(- a + 1\right) \left(r - 1\right) + H r \theta_{r} \left(2 a - 1\right) \left(r - 1\right) \left(a r \theta_{r} - r \theta_{r} + r - 1\right)
\end{align}


\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:selective}
Using the utility model described in Section~\ref{section:the_model},
a population of selective poachers is stable if and only if:

\begin{equation}
    t > \frac{1}{1 - r^{\lceil{\frac{1}{\theta_{r}}}\rceil - 1}}
    \frac{F + H \theta_{r} (1 - r) ^{1- \alpha -\beta}-\Gamma/r(1-r)^{1-\beta}}{F}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Direct substitution gives:

    \begin{align}
    J(1) &= \frac{1}{\left(- r + 1\right)^{\alpha + 1} \left(r - 1\right)}
                \left(
                    F \left(- r + 1\right)^{\beta}
                    \left(- r + 1\right)^{\alpha + 1}
                    \left(
                        r t -
                        r -
                        r^{\lceil{\frac{1}{\theta_{r}}}\rceil} t
                    \right)
                    - H r
                    \theta_{r}
                    \left(r - 1\right)^{2}
                \right) - \Gamma\\
		&= \left(F
                 \left(1 - r\right)^{\beta - 1}
                 \left(
                     r -
                     t(r - r^{\lceil{\frac{1}{\theta_{r}}}\rceil} )
                 \right) +
                 H r \theta_{r} \left(1 - r\right)^{-\alpha}
           \right)
           - \Gamma
    \end{align}

The required condition is \(J(1)<0\):

\begin{align}
    F
    \left(1 - r\right)^{\beta - 1}r +
    H r \theta_{r}
    \left(1 - r\right)^{-\alpha}
    - \Gamma
            & < F \left(1 - r\right)^{\beta - 1}
    t(r - r^{\lceil{\frac{1}{\theta_{r}}}\rceil} )\\
    \frac{r}{r - r^{\lceil{\frac{1}{\theta_{r}}}\rceil}}
    \frac{F + H \theta_{r} \left(1 - r\right)^{1-\beta-\alpha} -
    \Gamma/r(1-r)^{1-\beta}}{F} & < t
\end{align}

which gives the required result.

\end{proof}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Note that limit of rhs as \(r\to1^-\) is \(\infty\) so simply
        devaluing
        all rhinos is not a valid approach.
    \item The equilibrium predicted in~\cite{Lee} can be obtained in specific
        setting.
\end{itemize}

Note that similar theoretic results have been obtained about the evolutionary
stability of indiscriminate poachers but these have been omitted for the sake of
clarity.

In this section we have analytically studied the stability of all the possible
equilibria. We have proven that all potential equilibria are possible.  All of
these theoretic results have been verified empirically, and the data for this
has been archived at~\cite{Glynatsi2017}. % TODO Rerun the data.

Figure~\ref{fig:convergence-over-r} shows a number of scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \input{list_of_scenarios.tex}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/steady_populations.pdf}
    \caption{Evolutionary stable populations for varying values of \(t, r,
    \Gamma\) for 6 difference scenarios.}
    \label{fig:convergence-over-r}
\end{figure}

These simulations confirm Theorem~\ref{theorem:selective}:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Too high value of \(r\) force the population to become indiscriminate
        even with a high disincentive.
    \item For all scenarios a value of \(r\) does exist for which a selective
        population will subsist.
\end{itemize}

This confirms that devaluing alone is not a solution and in fact can
potentially have averse consequences: combinations of devaluing and
education (creating a disincentive) is needed.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{section:discussion}

% TODO Redo this

In this work the dynamics of a selective population were explored. It was shown
that given sufficient risk associated with killing a Rhino it would be possible
for a selective population of poachers to subsist..

Numerical results indicate that even when there is a large disincentive,
devaluing of all Rhinos would lead to a population of indiscriminate poachers.
Therefore, the proportion of rhinos
which could be saved is limited, so approaches which aim to reduce demand (as
suggested in~\cite{Duan2013}) would have more potential.

The disincentive factor can have several interpretations. According to~\cite{Duan2017},
engaging the rural communities that neighbour or live with wildlife is the
key to fighting the illegal trade of wildlife. Strengthening disincentives for
illegal behaviour can be interpreted as the disincentive factor. Likewise,
increasing incentives for wildlife stewardship, decreasing the cost of living
with wildlife, and supporting livelihood that is not related to poaching can
serve as incentives for selective behaviour.

Note that the proportion of devalued rhinos \(r\) is continuous over \([0, 1]\)
in the model. However, standard practice of a given park manager in almost all
cases is to either devalue all the animals in a defined enclosed area, or none
at all. This is thought to be because partial devaluing tends to disturb
rhino social structures. The theoretic model presented here, whilst allowing for
consideration at the park level with park managers playing a mixed strategy, also
can be considered at the macroeconomic level. Where \(r\) represents the quantity
of devalued rhinos available across multiple parks.

The insights gained, notably that a population of selective poachers is
sustainable only if a large disincentive is in place (even if all rhinos have
been devalued) have implication at the long term national policy level.

Following discussions with environmental specialists it is clear that devaluing
is empirically thought to be one of the best responses to poaching. This
indicates that whilst of theoretic and macroeconomic interest, the modelling
approach investigated in this work has potential for further work. For example,
a detailed study of two neighbouring parks with differing policies could be
studied using a game theoretic model. Another interesting study would be to
introduce a third strategy available to poachers: this would represent the
possibility of not poaching (perhaps finding another source of income) and/or
leaving the current environment to poach elsewhere.
